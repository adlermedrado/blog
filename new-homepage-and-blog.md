New homepage and blog

The Web is a piece of crap nowadays, big corps want to track you at all costs 
and decide what we view, they determine what we should see, read, say, etc.

Offering convenience they slave us.

I'm trying to leave this world, so I made a new [homepage][1] and [blog][2], with no 
trackers, no analytics, no bullshit. 
Only HTML, CSS, a minimum of Javascript, Gopher and content for those who can 
be interested.

Step by step I'll get out, first of all the social media.

I really am disappointed when I see people referring to Google and Facebook as
if they were the internet, when in fact they are the ones who are killing the web.

Some days ago I've found the anti-social-media manifesto at gopher, written 
by a member called *papa* and I'll reproduce it below:

**Antisocial Media Manifesto by papa**

Version 1

1. Large social media systems have too much power over what content we view and how we
 interact with others over the Internet.

2. They have this power because we users have freely given it to them in exchange for
convenience.

3. By granting so much power to others, we risk losing our freedom of expression and f
reedom of choice.

4. We can reclaim our freedom by exercising it.

5. The process is never-ending. There is no permanent safe haven for us in this world.
